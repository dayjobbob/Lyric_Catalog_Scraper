Cause my lover is gone, gone on
Never too young to pay your dues
And if you're walkin in my shoes
You're a child with the blues
So blue, so blue..
I can't stop the flow, can't stop it
Of wet tears in my eyes

Which one are you, which one is me?
Friends, fans, and artist must meet
Which one are you, which one are me?
FANS
God, please, o, please let her breathe my way
If she sing my song today I can be okay
I was really happy for her when she won tonight
She a rebel for the struggle, fighting just like me
I know she down to sing at the cookout for free
I was kinda disappointed with the song she wrote
Went to her website, wrote a long ass note
She done made a million dollars, but she down to earth
She be rocking Chuck Taylors and a thrift sto' purse
Signing autographs 'til the park was dark
I know it's kinda hard when they love your art
In the magazines they be twisting up the facts
But her response was fair, I like how she come back
She be sanging for the world, sharing all her pain
When she fell up in the game she had changed
Fans, friends, artist must meet
Which one are you which 1 are me
FRIENDS
Folk in the face like she ain't the same
Still the same bitch, she just changed her name
She don't really like to hang around with us no mo '
Wasn't nothing like that back in '94
She be falling in the spot with a fat aass grin
Now she roll a Benz, she don't need no friends
She only really made it cause her skin is light
Don't nobody really understand that shit she write
She done made a million dollars ,she can give us some
She be having fun, shit we wanna have fun
Gon' be looking really funny when her shit don't sell
Airport, 'bout to miss a flight
Four carry-ons talking 'bout ""pack light""
Oo, please, o, please give the queen her tea
I only come to the show cause i get in free

Which one are you which one are me?
Fans, friends, and artist must meet
Which 1 are you ?
ARTIST
Folk in my face cause I'm a supastar
Niggass hang around cause of who I are
Get a lot of love cause of what I got
Say they happy for me, but they really not
Sell a lot of records and I roll a Benz
Fall up in the spot, now I'm losing friends
All I wanna do is give the world my heart
Record label trying to make me compromise my art
Make a million dollars, make a million mo '
Tax time come around, still a nigga po'
I wanna say wait, but I'm scared to ask
The world start spinning and it's moving fast
Try to stay sane, it's the price of fame
Spending my life trying to numb the pain
I shake that load off and sing the song
Liberate the mind and I go on home"

Like to the movies or the Applebee's, Blockbuster, State fair
But you looked at me and said: ""Fuck that!""
You just a herb with no money, and no jeep, and no condo
When I thought that Little Brother had a record deal
Okay, I see where you're going now
Wanna sweat a nigga when you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time, but fuck that
I got your head still bobbin' and my verse didn't rhyme
So it's whatever, girl
Honey, yeah, oh
You so sweet...well... (Honey...)
Hey, you make me think, Ow!

One-one-one-one, one-two, one-two
On & on & on & on
Wake the fuck up 'cause it's been too long
Say, wait a minute, Queen, what's your name?
Ascension maintained
Rolling through like a burning flame
Like a supernova star
She be the light when they in the dark
Morning
The moon pass the sun
Four constellations start forming
A cross up in the sky
But everybody wanna ask me why
What good do your words do if they can't understand you?
Don't go talkin' that shit Badu, Badu
Said I'm a Pisces
Zika deka del
Well, well, I'm raising hell
People always tryin' to find the world I'm in
I'm the envy of the women and I rule the men
Two fish, one swimmin' up stream
One swimmin' down livin' in a dream
But when she loves she tends to cling
When incense burns, smoke unfurls
Analog girl in a digital world
The Rasta style flower child
Zip dip dow, zip dip dow
The gold tooth smile
Split them vowels
Bling bloom bling, melanated
I'm 'bout ta give birth to church
But everybody want to ask this Earth
What...
Bridge!
I remember when I went
With Momma to the Washateria
Remember how I felt the day
I first started my period
Remember there in school one day
I learned I was inferior
Water in my cereal
Badu in your stereo
Holla if you hear me though
Remembering is good if you don't
Let it be the fear in you
Wrap ya head with this material (Material)

Tempted but the truth is discovered

Now that you have gone
There's no other

The baggage carousel
The people keep on crowding
I'm wishing I was well
I said it's no occasion
It's no story I could tell
At my bedside empty pocket
A foot without a sock
Your body gets much closer
I fumble for the clock
Alarmed by the seduction
I wish it would stop
I bought a novel, some perfume
A fortune all for you

That hates to be untrue

She makes $280 a week, standing on her feet
The ends ain't even meetin', the family ain't eatin'
And the taxes is 10%, the rest is for the rent

I don't have to tell you things aren't good. Everybody knows things aren't good. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat. Young punks are running the street. No one knows just what to do and there's no end to it. The dollar buys a penny's worth, the banks are going under, coppers keeping a gun under the counter. We sit watching our idiot boxes while some local anchorman tells us that today we've had eighteen murders and eighty violent crimes, as if that were the way things are supposed to be. We know times are bad--worse than bad. People are crazy. It's like everything, everywhere is going utterly mad, so we never leave our homes. We sit in our comfy abodes while the world is getting smaller and we say, ""C'mon, at least leave us alone in our family rooms. Let me have my microwave and flat screen and my 20-inch wheels and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone."" Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get angry! I don't want you to riot. I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to write to your senator because I won't know what to tell you to tell him.

They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another.
